English and medical spellchecker for Anki flashcard software

Credit

Spellchecker: Lovac42's add-on Spelling Police was modified to enable Anki's built-in spellchecker.

Changes made: Joseph Yasmeh simplified the settings and added code to automatically install the English and medical dictionaries, without requiring user input. 

Dictionaries: The medical <a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/hunspell-en-med-glut-workaround">.dic file</a> was made by Glutanimate (Aristotelis P.), using works by R. Robinson and Rajasekharan N. 

Changes made: Joseph converted the dictionary into a medical .bdic file that Anki can read. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time such a file is publicly available.
